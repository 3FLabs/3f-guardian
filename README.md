# bun-guardian

Monorepo for the **Guardian** off-chain signer service — the v1 contract specified at
[gist b50021fb3ee2c059d228b4dcddbb577e](https://gist.github.com/maxencerb/b50021fb3ee2c059d228b4dcddbb577e).

The Guardian attests privileged on-chain actions: a caller submits the intended action,
the Guardian evaluates a fixed catalogue of policy & on-chain checks, and on success
returns an EIP-712 signature that the caller submits alongside its transaction.

## Packages

| Package | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`@3flabs/guardian`](./packages/guardian) | `packages/guardian` | HTTP shell. Hosts plug in policy, signing, and chain access via a typed `GuardianAbstractions` contract. |
| [`@3flabs/guardian-defaults`](./packages/guardian-defaults) | `packages/guardian-defaults` | Default `Logger` (pino), in-memory rate limiter, and Appendix-A check builders. |
| `@3flabs/guardian-test-fixtures` | `packages/guardian-test-fixtures` | **Private, never published.** Shared on-chain fixtures (prool-anvil pool + foundry artifacts + deployment script) consumed by the integration suites in both public packages. |

`@3flabs/guardian-defaults` depends on `@3flabs/guardian` via `workspace:*`. The shell never owns
RPCs, secrets, or signing keys; the defaults package adds opinionated implementations a host can
plug in piece-by-piece.

## Stack

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) workspaces (no pnpm); per-package builds with `tsc` emitting `.js` + `.d.ts`.
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) for routing, [Zod](https://zod.dev) for schemas.
- [viem](https://viem.sh/) for chain reads & EIP-712 signing.
- [better-result](https://better-result.dev) for typed `Result<T, E>` flow.
- [@noble/hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes) for HMAC-SHA-256.
- [pino](https://getpino.io/) + [pino-pretty](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) for the default logger.
- [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/quickstart) + [oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter/quickstart) for lint & format.
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev) for tests.
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning + npm publish via GitHub OIDC trusted-publisher (no `NPM_TOKEN` secret).

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck       # tsc --noEmit per package + scripts/
bun run lint            # oxlint --deny-warnings over packages, vitest configs, scripts/
bun run format          # oxfmt over packages, vitest configs, scripts/
bun run test            # vitest per package (unit only)
bun run test:integration # vitest, prool-anvil per worker (requires anvil on PATH)
bun run build           # tsc emit .js + .d.ts per package
```

The root `build` / `test` / `test:integration` / `typecheck` scripts invoke each package
explicitly via `bun run --cwd packages/<pkg> …`, so a missing package script fails loudly.
Bun itself is pinned through the root `packageManager` field (`bun@1.3.14`); CI reads it
via setup-bun's `bun-version-file`, so bumping Bun is a single-line change.

Per-package work:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/guardian test
bun run --cwd packages/guardian-defaults build
```

## Running integration tests

The integration suites in `@3flabs/guardian` and `@3flabs/guardian-defaults` boot a real
[anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) per vitest worker via [prool](https://github.com/wevm/prool),
deploy the Guardian-relevant slice of the 3F protocol (Facility, RequestFactory + a real Request,
PositionManagerFactory + a real PositionManager, RequestWhitelist, TransferGuard,
IntentDescriptor, two MockERC20s, an `OwnableMockFund`, plus Multicall3 at the canonical address),
and exercise both the `@3flabs/guardian-defaults` Appendix-A check runners and the
`@3flabs/guardian` `makeSign*` orchestrators against the live deployment.

Prerequisites:

- `anvil` on `PATH` (install via `foundryup`).
- Node ≥ 22 / Bun ≥ 1.1.

Run from the repo root:

```bash
bun run test:integration
```

The shared fixtures package — `@3flabs/guardian-test-fixtures` — is private (`"private": true`)
and never published. It bundles foundry artifacts (bytecode + ABI) under `artifacts/` stamped
with their source commit hash (suffixed `-dirty` when extracted from a tree with uncommitted
changes). Regenerate them when the sibling repos (`grunt`, `3f-request-whitelist`) advance:

```bash
bun run fixtures:extract     # rewrite artifacts/*.json from sibling out/ trees
bun run fixtures:check       # validate bundled artifacts + fail-fast on sibling drift
```

`fixtures:check` runs in CI on every PR. It always validates the bundled artifacts'
integrity and only performs the sibling-drift comparison for repos whose forge output is
actually present (printing a `[fixtures] NOTICE` for each absent repo), so it passes on a
fresh clone without sibling checkouts.

## Releasing

1. After a code change, run `bun run changeset` and pick the affected package(s) and bump kind. Commit the resulting `.changeset/*.md`.
2. Push to `main`. The `release` workflow opens (or updates) a "Version Packages" PR.
3. Merge that PR. The workflow re-runs and publishes to npm with provenance via GitHub OIDC.

Before `changeset publish` runs, `scripts/rewrite-workspace-deps.ts` rewrites the workspace
manifests: `workspace:*` ranges become real versions, private workspace devDependencies
(e.g. `@3flabs/guardian-test-fixtures`) are dropped from the published manifests, and the
script errors if a private workspace package appears in `dependencies`, `peerDependencies`,
or `optionalDependencies`.

**One-time setup on npmjs.com**: add each package as an *OIDC trusted publisher* pointing at
`3FLabs/3f-guardian` repo / `release.yml` workflow. Without this, the publish step will
fail because no `NPM_TOKEN` is configured (intentional — we don't want long-lived secrets).
