/**
 * Builds the §A.2 fund-binding check runner.
 *
 * Performs the policy + on-chain checks the v1 spec calls out, in this
 * order (matches §6.4.1 emission):
 *
 *   1. deadline within MAX_DEADLINE_SECONDS_AHEAD of now           (422)
 *   2. fund contract is on the accepted-funds list                 (422)
 *   3. fund contract owner is on the accepted-owners list          (422)
 *   4. positionManager matches the intent's PM-flagged asset       (422)
 *   5. intent has no currently bound fund                          (409)
 *   6. fund holds DEPOSITOR_ROLE for the facility (skipped)        (—)
 *
 * Stage 1 multicall reads `fund.owner()` and `facility.getIntent(id)` in
 * a single round-trip — viem decodes each call to its ABI return type
 * via the `as const` contracts tuple. With `allowFailure: false` a
 * transport-level RPC failure throws and surfaces as
 * `UpstreamUnavailableError` (503), per §6.6. A DETERMINISTIC failure of
 * either read — `owner()` / `getIntent()` reverting or returning no data
 * because the client-supplied `fundContract` or `facility` is an EOA or
 * some unrelated contract — is instead a property of the request: it
 * fails the 422-class owner check (the read cannot prove an accepted
 * owner) and rolls up to `ValidationFailedError`.
 *
 * Per §6.6.1 the runner reports 422 if any 422-class check fails, even
 * when the 409 check (intent-has-no-current-fund) also fails. The 409
 * path is reached only when every 422-class entry passes.
 *
 * Two checks the spec discusses are intentionally omitted:
 *
 *  - Cross-intent collision ("fund is not bound to a different intent"):
 *    no efficient on-chain enumeration exists; the on-chain `setFund`
 *    call will revert anyway. Surfacing it pre-flight would only risk
 *    making the Guardian's view inconsistent with the chain.
 *
 *  - Proposed-fund internal-state cleanliness: `IFund` exposes only
 *    per-order `state(Order)`, not a free/busy getter, so we cannot
 *    cheaply ascertain that the proposed fund is idle without adding a
 *    new view to grunt. The on-chain `create()` path inside `setFund`
 *    will reject a busy fund — same fail-on-chain semantics as above.
